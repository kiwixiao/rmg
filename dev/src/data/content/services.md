Advanced respiratory engineering solutions by Airflow Inferred LLC

# Service 1: Airway Flow Modeling
Advanced computational fluid dynamics modeling of respiratory airways from nasal cavities to lung bronchioles. We create detailed 3D models to understand airflow patterns, pressure distributions, and breathing mechanics for medical research and clinical applications.

# Service 2: Inhaled Drug Delivery Deposition Quantification
Precise quantification and optimization of drug particle deposition in respiratory systems. Our advanced modeling techniques predict where and how much medication deposits in specific lung regions, enabling better therapeutic outcomes and drug formulation design.

# Service 3: Inhaler Device Optimization
Comprehensive analysis and optimization of inhaler devices including MDIs, DPIs, and nebulizers. We evaluate device performance, particle generation, flow dynamics, and delivery efficiency to help pharmaceutical companies develop more effective inhalation devices.

# Service 4: 3D Flow Rendering & Visualization
High-quality 3D visualizations and animations of respiratory airflow, particle trajectories, and drug deposition patterns. Our advanced rendering techniques create compelling visual representations for research presentations, regulatory submissions, and educational purposes.
